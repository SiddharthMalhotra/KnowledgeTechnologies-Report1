\section{Introduction}
\label{sec-intro}

Microblogging constitutes the modern method of using social networks. As there is a high input cost associated with using the mobile phone keypads, users tend to shorten their words. 
Twitter, for instance allows 140 or fewer characters, and generally contains hash tags and @ symbols. The proceeding sections describe in detail the various techniques that are applied to
identity: {Known} or {in-vocabulary} words; punctuation and special symbols (both general and Twitter specific); and candidates for normalisation. 
We then apply various normalisation techniques to correct out of vocabulary $OOV$ tokens.
